Introduction
-----------------
This app is built with the following technologies:

[Model View View Model](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) This guide encompasses best practices and recommended architecture for building robust, high-quality apps.
* [UI Layer](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer) The role of the UI is to display the application data on the screen and also to serve as the primary point of user interaction.
* [Data Layer](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/data-layer) The data layer contains application data and business logic.
* [Domain Layer](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/domain-layer) The domain layer is an optional layer that sits between the UI layer and the data layer.

[View Model](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. 

[Dagger Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection) Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.

[Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), Firebase is an app development platform that helps you build and grow apps and games users love. Backed by Google and trusted by millions of businesses around the world.

[Firebase - Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore), Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL document database that lets you easily store, sync, and query data for your mobile and web apps - at global scale.

[Firebase - Storage](https://firebase.google.com/products/storage), Cloud Storage is designed to help you quickly and easily store and serve user-generated content, such as photos and videos.

[Maps SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/), SDK to build dynamic, interactive, customized maps, location, and geospatial experiences for your Android apps.

[Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) Android Jetpack's Navigation component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer. 

[Kotlin Flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.

[View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) View binding is a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.

[Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.

[Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
